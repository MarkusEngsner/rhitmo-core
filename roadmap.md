## Roadmap
### Overview
The project currently consists of two main parts:
* The cli-interface
* The game back-end (the core)

### First steps
Plan:
 1. cli: Print board to terminal
 2. cli: game loop which allows moving pieces
 3. core: implement game-logic
 


### Beyond
With that done, there are 
three main branches for the development to focus on:

#### AI
Implementing an AI which is capable of playing the game well.


#### Networking
Allow people to play against each other from different computers.

The first step is over just the local network, perhaps with
a some kind of server.



#### The internet
Implement a scala.js front-end, in order to allow people to play on
the internet. 
This kind of requires either Networking or AI to be implemented.
